                works,
                which God prepared in advance for us to do.
            </p>
            <p><strong>1 Timothy 6:12</strong><br>Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to
                which you were called when you made your good
                confession in the presence of many witnesses.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>John 1:12</strong><br> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
                God, even to them that believe on his name.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Jeremeiah 29:11</strong><br>For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to
                prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you

            <h2>Meet The Founder:</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Power to Become</strong> was born from my own story.<br>
                I grew up in Mwingi, Kitui County, where dreams were big but guidance was limited. Like many rural
                youth, I wanted more
                for my future, but I didn't know where to start or who to ask.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything changed when I moved to Nairobi to join Multimedia University of Kenya. The transition was
                overwhelming. What
                many young people from urban areas seemed to understand naturally, such as navigating the city, choosing
                a career path,
                building networks, and growing in confidence, felt completely foreign to me. I faced culture shock,
                confusion, and
                moments of deep self-doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
                I lacked a mentor,someone who could show me the ropes, challenge me, encourage me, and
                help me discover my
                potential. I had to learn through struggle, and I knew it didn't have to be that way.
                <br><i>Those early challenges became my purpose.</i><br>
                After years of mentoring young people in schools, churches, and community programs, I realized just how
                many rural youth
                face the same hurdles I did. That is why I founded <strong>Power to Become</strong> to bridge the gap,
                offer guidance,
                and equip young
                people with the life skills, confidence, and mentorship they need to thrive.
                Today, <strong>Power to Become</strong> exists so that no young person has to walk their journey alone.
            </p>
