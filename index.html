            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Power to Become is an initiative born from lived experience in rural Kenya. Growing up, our founder
                faced
                firsthand the challenges of limited access to quality healthcare, education, and agricultural resources.
                These
                obstacles inspired a vision: to empower young people in marginalized communities by providing
                mentorship,
                digital skills, and exposure to transformative opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why these programs?</strong> We focus on healthcare, education, and agriculture because these
                are
                the
                pillars that shape livelihoods in rural Africa. By addressing these areas, we aim to break cycles of
                poverty
                and
                unlock the potential within every young person.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Our Vision:</strong> To ignite a movement where data-driven innovation transforms communities,
                enabling
                young people to thrive and become agents of change. As we scale, our goal is to create a ripple
                effect‚Äîempowering not just individuals, but entire communities across Africa.

            <p>
                <strong>Priscilla Nzula</strong> is a passionate advocate for youth empowerment and community
                transformation. Growing up in rural Kenya, she experienced the realities of limited education,
                healthcare,
                and agricultural resources‚Äîchallenges that fueled her drive to create opportunities for others.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a strong background in data science and community leadership, Priscilla is committed to bridging
                opportunity gaps through technology, mentorship, and innovation. Her work equips young people with the
                skills, confidence, and resilience to thrive, while inspiring them to become catalysts of change in
                their
                own communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guided by the belief that local insight combined with innovative solutions can break cycles of poverty,
                Priscilla envisions an Africa where every young person has the power to succeed and the tools to shape a
                brighter future.

                <p>
                    Through mentorship, I have helped students turn doubt into confidence, guiding over 100 to excel in
                    exams, join top
                    universities, and pursue careers with purpose. The greatest reward has been watching young people
                    who
                    once saw only
                    limitation discover their potential and embrace ambitious dreams.

                            ‚ÄúBefore meeting Priscilla, I struggled to see the value of education. My family couldn‚Äôt
                            afford
                            much, and hope felt distant. Through her consistent mentorship, encouragement, and guidance
                            in
                            both
                            academics and personal resilience, I not only excelled in my national exams but also earned
                            admission into university. Today, I am thriving and inspiring others in my village to
                            believe in
                            themselves and persist.‚Äù<br>

                            coding, starting from scratch with Python. Step by step, I moved from beginner to

                            real projects. Today, I am creating data-driven agricultural solutions‚Äîproof that when
